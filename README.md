## Hostel Booking Website

This project is a simple *Hostel Booking System* that allows students to view available hostels, check details, and book rooms online. 
It provides a user-friendly interface for managing hostel reservations and helps automate the manual process of room allocation. 
The system can be extended with features like admin controls, payment integration, and booking history.
The website is built using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript* for the frontend, with *Node.js* as the backend runtime and *MySQL* for database management.
This stack provides a responsive interface along with a reliable server and efficient data handling.
