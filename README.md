## Hostel Booking Website

This project is a simple *Hostel Booking System* that allows students to view available hostels, check details, and book rooms online. 
It provides a user-friendly interface for managing hostel reservations and helps automate the manual process of room allocation. 
The system can be extended with features like admin controls, payment integration, and booking history.
The website is built using *HTML, CSS, JavaScript* for the frontend and *PHP with MySQL* for the backend and database management.
These tools provide a lightweight yet effective solution for creating a responsive and dynamic hostel booking platform.
